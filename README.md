Cardboard Home
=============

Cardboard Home is an Android launcher designed for use with the Google Cardboard virtual reality headset. Cardboard Home is intended to replace a regular launcher when the user places their device inside a Google Cardboard viewer.
Unlike a regular launcher, Cardboard Home uses side by side 3D to display a launcher interface that is useable while inside a Google Cardboard. The launcher can be controlled simply by the user moving his or her head and "clicking" with the magetic ring. Cardboard Home only displays applications that accpept the cardboard:// intent, and any other applications that the user hand picks. When the user exits Cardboard Home, it brings them back to their regular launcher, making for a fairly seemless experience.
